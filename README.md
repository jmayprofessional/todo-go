# todo-go
Building an API with Gin and Go Language


How to run this code:

Please download this repo at your convenience. Once you open this repo in your IDE (reccomend Visual Studio Code or Jetbrains).

Open a terminal inside your IDE and type the following to start our server at localhost:9090

`go run main.go`

Once your server has sucessfully started please navigate to your Google Chrome Broswer and check out your first endpoint here:

`localhost:9090/todo`

If you would like to test the full capabilities of this tiny API project, I'd reccomend plugging your requests into Postman, for example you can test the PATCH endpoint and watch the toggle functionality.

Thanks and hopefully you continue to watch as I progressively dive deeper and deeper into learning and applying Go Lang!
